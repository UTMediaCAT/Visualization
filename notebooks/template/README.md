# Template Visualization 

In this directory you will find a variety of different diagrams and charts.  You will need to modify *helper.ipynb* in order to start data visualization.

# Instructions

Follow these instructions to configure the diagrams and charts for data visualization:
1. Adjust the constant variables in *helper.ipynb* to match the provided *.csv* file
2. Modify any other constants in the other notebooks based on what you want to visualize

Please note that every Jupyter notebook should also have its own instructions to follow.
