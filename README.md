# Visualization

This repository uses Jupyter Notebook for data visualization from results generated by the post processor.  The post processor can be found [here](https://github.com/UTMediaCAT/Post-processor).

# Prerequisites

You will need:
- Python3
	- jupyter
	- pandas
	- matplotlib
	- d3graph
- Input .csv file from post processor

As long as you have the **pip** command line tool, the modules should be automatically installed when you run the main script.  If there is an error installing the modules, whether it be due to user permissions or other reasons, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Instructions

1. Modify the constant variable **INPUT** in *main.py* to match the name of the *.csv* file
2. Call `python main.py`

The Jupyter Notebook should open in a web browser and be ready to visualize the data provided by the given *.csv* file.
